# xDSCResourceDesigner

The **xDSCResourceDesigner** module is a part of the Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) Resource Kit, which is a tool to author PowerShell DSC Resources and produced by the PowerShell Team.This tool makes writing resources a breeze and ensure that all the rules which a DSC resource must conform to are met.

**All of the functions/cmdlets in the Resource Designer Tool are provided AS IS, and are not supported through any Microsoft standard support program or service.
The "x" in xDSCResourceDesigner stands for experimental**, which means that this tool will be **fix forward** and monitored by the module owner(s).

## Installation

To install **xDSCResourceDesigner** module

*   Unzip the content under $env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder

To confirm installation:

*   Run **Get-Module -ListAvailable** to see that **xDSCResourceDesigner** is among the modules listed

## Requirements

This module requires the latest version of PowerShell (v4.0, which ships in Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012R2).
To easily use PowerShell 4.0 on older operating systems, [install WMF 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40855).
Please read the installation instructions that are present on both the download page and the release notes for WMF 4.0.

## Description

The **xDSCResourceDesigner ** module exposes 6 functions: **New-xDscResourceProperty, New-xDscResource, Update-xDscResource, Test-xDscResource, Test-xDscSchema and Import-xDscSchema **.
These uses of these functions are given below.

## Details

**xDSCResourceDesigner** module exposes the following functions:

*   **New-xDscResourceProperty**: For creating a property for the resource
*   **New-xDscResource**: for creating the actual resource containing the schema and module skeleton
*   **Update-xDscResource**: for updating an existing resource with new properties
*   **Test-xDscResource**: for testing whether an existing resource conforms to the rules required by DSC
*   **Test-xDscSchema**: for testing whether an existing schema (schema.mof) conforms to the rules required by DSC
*   **Import-xDscSchema**: for getting the properties in a schema returned as a hashtable

## Versions

### Unreleased

### 1.12.0.0

* Fixed `Test-MockSchema` to return True if class name matches resource name when there are multiple embeded classes in the schema mof. [issue #123](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDSCResourceDesigner/issues/73).

### 1.11.0.0

* Added support for Codecov.
* Fix Test-xDscSchema failing to call `Remove-WmiObject` on PowerShell Core.
  The cmdlet `Remove-WmiObject` was removed from the code, instead the
  temporary CIM class is now removed by using mofcomp.exe and the
  preprocessor command [pragma deleteclass](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa392751(v=vs.85).aspx)
  (issue #67).

### 1.10.0.0
* Converted appveyor.yml to install Pester from PSGallery instead of from Chocolatey.
* Helper function Test-xDscSchemaEncoding now supports PowerShell Core (issue #64).
* Changed README.md encoding to UTF8.

### 1.9.0.0

* Fixed issue where using ValidateSet with type string[] would throw an error

### 1.8.0.0

* Fixed issue where ValueMap on an Array was incorrectly flagged as an error

### 1.7.0.0

* Error message improvements

### 1.6.0.0

* Fixed issue with not being able to import the module twice

### 1.5.0.0

* Fixed issue with adding type twice through Add-Type

### 1.4.0.0

* Added support and tests for -FriendlyName on Update-xDscResource
* Added tests for creating and updating resources
* Minor fixes for Update-xDscResource

### 1.3.0.0

* Minor fixes after PowerShell.org fork merge.

### 1.2.0.0

Merged changes from PowerShell.org fork

* Removed #Requires -RunAsAdministrator.
The commands that require Administrator rights already check for it anyway, and this allows the rest of the module to be used from a normal PowerShell session.
* Added support for Enum types (with associated ValueMap)
* Added support for EmbeddedInstances other than MSFT_Credential and MSFT_KeyValuePair
* Fixed parameter name in Test-xDscResource comment-based help to match actual command definition
* Updated Test-xDscResource to use a process block, since it accepts pipeline input.
* Fixed invalid use of try/catch/finally in Test-MockSchema and Test-DscResourceModule
* Updated code related to Common parameters; now handles all common parameters properly based on command metadata.
* Added very basic tests for Test-xDscResource; these need to be fleshed out quite a bit later.

### 1.1.2

*   Ignore -WhatIf and -Confirm internal parameters to suppress false errors when Set-TargetResource declares [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$true)]

### 1.1.1.1

*   Metadata updates.

### 1.0.0.0

*   Initial release for xDSCResourceDesigner

## Examples

## Create a Sample DSC ADUser Resource
This example creates a ADUser DSC resource.

```powershell
<#
Create a ADUser DSC Resource with following properties
UserName: Name of the ADUser.
This is a  key property for the resource that uniquely identify an instance.
Password: Password of the user.
Can be used to update an existing user password.
DomainAdminstratorCredential: Credential of the Domain Administrator in which user account will be created.
Ensure: Whether an user account should be created or deleted.
This can only take two values: ‘Present’ and ‘Absent’.
#>

$UserName = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name UserName -Type String -Attribute Key
$Password = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name Password -Type PSCredential -Attribute Write
$DomainCredential = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name DomainAdministratorCredential -Type PSCredential -Attribute Write
$Ensure = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name Ensure -Type String -Attribute Write -ValidateSet "Present", "Absent"
#Now create the resource
New-xDscResource -Name Contoso_cADUser -Property $UserName, $Password, $DomainCredential, $Ensure  -Path 'C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\xActiveDirectory'


### Test an Incorrect Resource Definition

This example will use Test-xDscSchema function to check if the resource definition is correct or not

```powershell
<#
Suppose you have the following schema (named buggy.schema.mof):
[ClassVersion("1.0.0.0"), FriendlyName("")]
class Contoso_cADUser : OMI_BaseResource
{
       [Key] String UserName;
       [Write, ValueMap{"Present","Absent"}, Values{"Present","Absent"}] String Ensure;
};
#>
# This reports that the schema is buggy.
Test-xDscSchema -Path .\buggy.schema.mof
<#
Suppose you have the following schema (named buggy.schema.mof):
[ClassVersion("1.0.0.0"), FriendlyName("")]
class Contoso_cADUser : OMI_BaseResource
{
       [Key] String UserName;
       [Write, ValueMap{"Present","Absent"}, Values{"Present","Absent"}] String Ensure;
};
#>

# This reports that the schema is buggy.

Test-xDscSchema -Path .\buggy.schema.mof
```


### Updates an Existing Resource
This example will use Update-xDscResource function to update an already existing resource properties

```powershell
#Assume, you want to add an additional property called LastLogOn on existing Constoso_cADUser resource
$lastLogOn = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name LastLogOn -Type Hashtable -Attribute Read -Description "Returns the user last log on time"
#Update the existing resource
Update-xDscResource -Name 'Contoso_cADUser' -Property $UserName, $Password, $DomainCredential, $Ensure, $lastLogOn -Force
#Assume, you want to add an additional property called LastLogOn on existing Constoso_cADUser resource

$lastLogOn = New-xDscResourceProperty -Name LastLogOn -Type Hashtable -Attribute Read -Description "Returns the user last log on time"

#Update the existing resource
Update-xDscResource -Name 'Contoso_cADUser' -Property $UserName, $Password, $DomainCredential, $Ensure, $lastLogOn -Force
```
