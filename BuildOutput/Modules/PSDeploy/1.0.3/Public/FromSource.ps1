# From is a reserved keyword...
Function FromSource {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Specify sources to deploy in a 'By' block of a PSDeploy.ps1

    .DESCRIPTION
        Specify sources to deploy in a 'By' block of a PSDeploy.ps1

        This is not intended to be used anywhere but in a *.PSDeploy.ps1 file. It is included here for intellisense support

        We can't use 'From,' given that Microsoft reserves this for future use as a keyword

    .PARAMETER Source
        One or more source items to deploy.

        If we can test-path, we assume it's absolute.  If we can't we assume it's relative, and join with DeploymentRoot.
        You can override this by using WithOptions @{ SourceIsAbsolute = $true }

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule {
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\MyModule'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }
        }

        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule {
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\MyModule'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }

            By FileSystem Tasks {
                FromSource 'Tasks'
                To 'C:\sc\Tasks'
            }
        }

        # This illustrates using two of the same DeploymentTypes, with different options and details.
        # We specify a name to ensure uniqueness of the resulting DeploymentName: DeployMyModule and DeployMyModule-Tasks
        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)
        # This would deploy the folder Tasks to C:\sc\Tasks, without mirroring.
