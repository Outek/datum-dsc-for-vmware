Function By {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Specify details about the DeploymentType for deployments defined in a PSDeploy.ps1

    .DESCRIPTION
        Specify details about the DeploymentType for deployments defined in a PSDeploy.ps1

        This is not intended to be used anywhere but in a *.PSDeploy.ps1 file. It is included here for intellisense support

    .PARAMETER DeploymentType
        The type of deployment you are defining. For example, a FileSystem deployment.

        See Get-PSDeploymentType for a list of valid deployment types.

    .PARAMETER Name
        An optional name for the deployment in this 'By' block.

        This would be needed if you wanted more than one 'By' block for a single DeploymentType.

        This is tacked on to the Deploy Name: DeployName-ByName.

    .PARAMETER Script
        Details on the deployment. You can include the following functions inside your By:
            - FromSource:  The item(s) you are deploying. Required.
            - To:          The target(s) you are deploying to. Required.
            - WithOptions:   Any DeploymentType specific options

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule {
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\MyModule'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }
        }

        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)

    .EXAMPLE

        # This is a complete PSDeploy.ps1 example including a By function

        Deploy DeployMyModule {
            By FileSystem {
                FromSource 'MyModule'
                To 'C:\sc\MyModule'
                WithOptions @{
                    Mirror = $True
                }
            }

            By FileSystem Tasks {
                FromSource 'Tasks'
                To 'C:\sc\Tasks'
            }
        }

        # This illustrates using two of the same DeploymentTypes, with different options and details.
        # We specify a name to ensure uniqueness of the resulting DeploymentName: DeployMyModule and DeployMyModule-Tasks
        # This would deploy the folder 'MyModule' to C:\sc\MyModule. It would mirror (i.e. remove items that are not in the source)
        # This would deploy the folder Tasks to C:\sc\Tasks, without mirroring.
